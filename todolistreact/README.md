# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Backend API Host/Port Configuration

This React app uses the environment variable `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` to determine the backend API host and port.

### How to set the backend address:
1. Create a `.env` file in the `ToDoListReact` directory (already present in this repo).
2. Add the following line (change the URL to match your backend):

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

- For local development, use your backend's local address (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`).
- For production, use your deployed backend URL (e.g. `https://myapi.example.com`).

### How it works
- All API calls (login, register, todo CRUD, health check) will use this base URL.
- If the variable is not set, the app will default to relative URLs (same host as frontend).

### Changing the backend address
- Edit `.env` and restart the React dev server (`npm start`) for changes to take effect.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
